This folder contains notes and files for building the physical soft gripper and reproducing hardware experiments.

- See `motor_control/` for Dynamixel-based motor control scripts.
- CAD, fabrication notes, and assembly tips can be found here.

High-level workflow:
1) Print/prepare the soft gripper parts per fabrication notes.
2) Assemble tendons, anchors, and mounting hardware.
3) Connect motors and verify communication (see `motor_control/`).
4) Map simulator parameters (e.g., tendon positions, stiffness) to physical settings.
